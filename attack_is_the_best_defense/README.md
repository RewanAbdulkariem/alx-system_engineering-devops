#  Attack is the best defense
This project explores various offensive security techniques and exercises related to network security, scripting, and hacking.

## Project Overview
This project is an optional opportunity to delve into offensive security practices. The tasks provided cover two main areas: **sniffing unencrypted traffic** and **conducting a dictionary attack against an SSH account**.

### Tasks
1. **ARP Spoofing and Sniffing Unencrypted Traffic**
This task involves using tcpdump to sniff unencrypted traffic and extract information, specifically targeting legacy systems like Telnet.
2. **Dictionary Attack**
Perform a dictionary attack using hydra on an SSH account within a Docker container. The objective is to brute-force an SSH password using a password dictionary.
